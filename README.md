## Oh My Zsh Stigmata Theme

Custom theme I made for Oh My Zsh 

### Indicator Meaning:

- Red ⨺ = Indicates that the current repository has uncommitted changes. These changes need to be committed to turn the indicator green.
- Green ⨺ = Indicates that the current repository is clean, with no uncommitted changes. You're good to go!
